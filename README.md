Input Methods: Users can input Sudoku puzzles either manually through the graphical interface or by loading a puzzle from a text file.
Solver Algorithm: The solver employs an efficient backtracking algorithm to find the solution for the given Sudoku puzzle.
Visual Feedback: Users can visualize the solving process step by step within the GUI, enabling them to understand how the solver works.
Validation: Before solving, the application validates the input Sudoku puzzle to ensure it follows the rules of Sudoku.
Solution Display: Once solved, the application displays the solution to the user within the GUI, providing instant feedback.
Error Handling: The application detects and handles errors gracefully, notifying users of any invalid input or unsolvable puzzles.
